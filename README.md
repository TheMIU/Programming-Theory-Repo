Submission 2 for Unity jr programmer pathway (OOP implementation)

* There are three different colored shapes that inherit from a base “shape” class (inheritance).

* When click on each shape, it prints something different to the screen through an overriden UpdateText() function (polymorphism).

* Each shape contains data, such as its name or color, which are stored as properties with getters and setters (encapsulation).

* Code is organized in a way that reduces duplicate code through higher level methods (abstraction).
